# What It Does
By utilizing machine learning, SnapNotes parses the notes presented on PowerPoint lecture slides and white boards by taking a photo and pulling out legible information. The notes captured in the photo are then transferred into a Firebase database that organizes all of them and allows students to access them in a central website domain.

In this page, users can add notes that they typed up to SnapNotes and organize it under one course folder. By doing this, users can then have a cloud platform that allows uploads either from the SnapNotes mobile app or even desktops or computers.

### Website Editing View

Another useful feature that SnapNotes has is that it allows users to edit their notes on the SnapNotes website. This helps users to organize their notes better and even to correct written typos that the Snapnotes mobile app may have made while parsing written notes from whiteboards or lecture slides.
