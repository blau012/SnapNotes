# What It Does
By utilizing machine learning, SnapNotes parses the notes presented on PowerPoint lecture slides and white boards by taking a photo and pulling out legible information. The notes captured in the photo are then transferred into a Firebase database that organizes all of them and allows students to access them in a central website domain.
